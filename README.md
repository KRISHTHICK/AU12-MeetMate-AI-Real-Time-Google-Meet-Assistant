"MeetMate AI – Real-Time Google Meet Assistant"
An AI Agent that directly joins your Google Meet sessions using your Google account credentials, captures audio + shared screen content, and automatically produces:

Live meeting notes

Key discussion points

Topic analytics (most discussed topics, speakers with most contributions)

Visuals like flowcharts from conversation context

Full summary at the end

High-Level Flow
Join Google Meet

Using Google Meet API & OAuth to authenticate your account.

Agent joins as a bot/participant (silent listener).

Audio Processing

Real-time transcription via Whisper or Google Speech-to-Text API.

Speaker diarization to identify who is talking.

Screen Share Analysis (Optional)

Captures periodic screenshots of shared screen (with permission).

Uses OCR & vision models (e.g., pytesseract or Google Cloud Vision API) to extract text from slides/documents.

Parallel Information Capture

Maintains synchronized timestamped transcript + screen content.

LLM Summarization & Analysis

Generates bullet-point summaries, action items, flowcharts.

Uses embeddings to detect most discussed topics.

Output

Live view in a Streamlit dashboard.

Final downloadable PDF/Docx report.

Example Agent Capabilities
“Give me a summary of the last 10 minutes of the meeting.”

“Who spoke the most?”

“Generate a flowchart for the workflow discussed.”

“What decisions were made today?”

“Highlight the main action items.”

Why This Needs an Agent (Not Just LLM)
✅ Multi-modal — combines speech, text, and visual data.
✅ Autonomous — joins, records, processes, and outputs without you manually prompting.
✅ Parallel Tasks — transcription, OCR, analytics, and summarization run simultaneously.
✅ Actionable Insights — not just text summarization, but structured data + charts.

If you want, I can give you full working code for a simplified version that:

Joins a sample meeting recording

Extracts audio → text (Whisper)

Extracts slides → text (OCR)

Summarizes into key points + charts

Then later, we can extend it to live Google Meet integration.
